     * What is the worst-case Big-O of the insert () algorithm for the AVL tree? Explain.
     * The worst-case would be O(logn). This is because an AVL tree is self balancing, so it only requires O(logn) to insert any item
     *
     * What is the worst-case Big-O of the printInOrder () algorithm for the AVL tree? Explain.
     * The worst-case would be O(n). This is because the tree is already sorted.
     *
     * What is the worst-case Big-O of the findMax () algorithm for the AVL tree? Explain.
     * The worst-case would be O(logn). When inserting multiple children it must traverse each child which leads to worst-case O(logn).
